A simple sudoku generator written using the Python wrapper of Z3. 

Generates a 23-clue, uniquely solvable sudoku. 23 is hard-coded, but easy to change or make a parameter in the function "make_sudoku". Can also be speeded up significantly by foregoing uniqueness check. 

Could use with a bit of refactoring, but I'll get to that (hopefully) when implementing some optimizations after getting a bit more familiar with Z3!
